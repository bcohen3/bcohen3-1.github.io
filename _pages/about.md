Hello! I am a M.S. in Computer Science student at [Johns Hopkins University](www.jhu.edu) with an anticipated completion date of December 2023. My research interests are interdisciplinary and focus on analyzing the impact of new technologies through a regulatory lens, with a particular (though not exclusive) focus on AI.

I taught [AP Computer Science Principles](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course) at [Towson High School](towsonhs.bcps.org) in [Baltimore County, Maryland](www.bcps.org), for six years (out of eight total at THS) and now work full-time as an AP Computer Science assessment specialist at [Educational Testing Service](www.ets.org) while teaching as an adjunct at [Towson University](https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/mathematics/). I also taught for the [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth](cty.jhu.edu) from 2017--21 after serving as a TA during the 2015 and 2016 summers.

I received my BA in [Economics](https://www.wesleyan.edu/econ/) from [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/) in 2010.
